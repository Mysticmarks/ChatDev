## üìñ Overview

**ChatDev** has evolved! It's now an **interactive Single Page Application (SPA)** that empowers you to visually create, manage, and interact with intelligent agents and their customizable "digital pets." This new platform provides a dynamic way to explore multi-agent systems, leveraging:

-   A **React-based frontend** for a responsive user experience.
-   **Gun.js** for decentralized real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
-   **Three.js** for visualizing customizable "pets" associated with your agents.
-   A powerful **Python backend (Flask-based API)** that handles core agent logic, LLM interactions (via CAMEL AI), and complex task processing.

While retaining its core philosophy of simulating a virtual software company with various intelligent agents (CEO, CPO, CTO, Programmer, etc.), ChatDev now focuses on providing a hands-on, visual environment for:

-   **Interactive Agent Creation:** Define agent roles, system prompts, and LLM models through the UI.
-   **Pet Customization:** Design unique visual companions (pets) for your agents using parameters that control their Three.js rendering.
-   **Real-time Collaboration (Conceptual):** While direct agent-to-agent software generation is evolving, the platform supports user-to-agent chat and task delegation.
-   **Decentralized Identity:** User accounts and agent/pet data are managed via Gun.js.

The primary objective of ChatDev is to offer an **easy-to-use**, **highly visual**, and **extendable** framework for building and experimenting with LLM-powered agents and their capabilities. It serves as an ideal platform for studying human-agent interaction, agent design, and decentralized application concepts.

‚Ä¢June 12, 2024: We introduced Multi-Agent Collaboration Networks (MacNet) üéâ, which utilize directed acyclic graphs to facilitate effective task-oriented collaboration among agents through linguistic interactions ü§ñü§ñ. MacNet supports co-operation across various topologies and among more than a thousand agents without exceeding context limits. More versatile and scalable, MacNet can be considered as a more advanced version of ChatDev's chain-shaped topology. Our preprint paper is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155). This technique has been incorporated into the [macnet](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/macnet) branch, enhancing support for diverse organizational structures and offering richer solutions beyond software development (e.g., logical reasoning, data analysis, story generation, and more).

## ‚ùì What Can ChatDev Do Now?

The new ChatDev SPA allows you to:

*   **Visually Design Agents:** Instead of command-line flags, use a graphical interface to define agent properties like system prompts, roles, and LLM models.
*   **Create Customizable "Pets":** Design unique visual companions for your agents using Three.js, defining their appearance through JSON parameters in the Toolbox.
*   **Interact with Agents:** Chat directly with your created agents, with conversations processed by the Python backend and CAMEL AI.
*   **Manage Agent and Pet Data:** User-specific data (agents, pets, credentials) is handled decentrally using Gun.js.
*   **Experiment with Prompt Engineering:** Use the self-improvement tool to refine prompts for better agent performance.
*   **Explore a Modular Frontend:** The SPA is built with React components, offering a modern user experience.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart (SPA & Backend API)

The new ChatDev consists of a Python backend API server and a frontend Single Page Application (SPA).

### 1. Backend Setup (Python API Server)

The backend server handles agent logic, LLM interactions, and serves as the brain for your agents.

1.  **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.git
    cd ChatDev
    ```

2.  **Set Up Python Environment:** (Python 3.9+ recommended)
    ```bash
    conda create -n ChatDev_env python=3.9 -y  # Or your preferred method
    conda activate ChatDev_env
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The `requirements.txt` file should include `Flask`, `Flask-CORS`, `python-dotenv`, `ecdsa`, and `camel-ai` (and its dependencies like `openai`, `tiktoken`).
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure your `requirements.txt` is updated for `api_server.py`)*

4.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    You'll need an OpenAI API key. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (or where `api_server.py` is located):
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_OpenAI_API_key_here"
    # Optional: Specify LLM model preferences if your API server uses them
    # OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini" 
    ```
    The `api_server.py` will load this using `python-dotenv`.

5.  **Run the API Server:**
    Navigate to the directory containing `api_server.py` (likely the root of the project now) and run:
    ```bash
    python api_server.py
    ```
    The server will typically start on `http://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in the script). You should see output indicating it's running.

### 2. Frontend Setup (SPA - Single Page Application)

The frontend is an HTML file that uses React, Gun.js, and Three.js via CDNs.

1.  **No Build Step Required:** Since the SPA uses CDN links for its main libraries and the custom JavaScript files (`gunService.js`, `AuthPage.js`, etc.) are directly included, there's no complex build process.

2.  **Run a Gun.js Relay Peer (Recommended for Data Persistence & Multi-user/Tab Sync):**
    Gun.js works peer-to-peer in the browser, but for better data persistence across sessions/browsers and for enabling data sync if you open multiple instances, running a local relay peer is highly recommended.
    *   Install Node.js if you don't have it.
    *   Install Gun globally or locally: `npm install -g gun` (or `npm install gun` in a dedicated folder).
    *   Start a simple relay peer:
        ```bash
        gun
        ```
        This will typically start a peer on `http://localhost:8765/gun`.
    *   **Note:** The `gunService.js` in the SPA is currently initialized with `const gun = GUN();` which defaults to local storage and peer discovery. For it to reliably use your local relay, you might need to adjust it to `const gun = GUN(['http://localhost:8765/gun']);`. *This change in `gunService.js` is recommended for a stable experience.*

3.  **Open `index.html` in Your Browser:**
    *   Navigate to the directory where `index.html` is located.
    *   Simply open `index.html` directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it or using `File > Open` in your browser).
    *   Ensure that all associated JavaScript files (`App.js`, `AuthPage.js`, `DashboardComponent.js`, `AgentCreationComponent.js`, `AgentListComponent.js`, `AgentInteractionComponent.js`, `ChatViewComponent.js`, `ToolboxComponent.js`, `PetFormComponent.js`, `PetSpriteComponent.js`, and `gunService.js`) are in the same directory as `index.html`, or update the script paths in `index.html` if they are organized into subdirectories.

4.  **Interact with the SPA:**
    *   You should see the login/register page. Create an account (this is handled by Gun.js).
    *   Once logged in, you can create agents, customize pets in the toolbox, and chat with your agents.
    *   Ensure the Python API server is running for agent interactions.

### üê≥ Quickstart with Docker

*(Placeholder: Docker instructions need to be updated to reflect the new SPA + API server architecture. This would involve a Docker Compose setup to run both the Python API server and a Gun.js relay peer, and serve the static frontend files.)*

For now, please follow the manual setup instructions above.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Advanced Skills & Customization

The new ChatDev SPA offers several avenues for customization:

*   **Agent Behavior:** Modify agent system prompts, roles, and LLM models directly through the UI to tailor their expertise and responses.
*   **Pet Appearance:** Experiment with different `spriteParams` (color, shape, size) in the Toolbox to create unique visual pets for your agents.
*   **Frontend Components:** The React-based frontend is modular. Developers can extend or modify existing components (`ChatViewComponent`, `AgentCreationComponent`, etc.) or add new ones. *(Refer to `App.js` and individual component files for structure)*.
*   **Backend API:** The Python Flask server (`api_server.py`) can be extended with new endpoints to add more complex agent capabilities or tools.
*   **Gun.js Data Schema:** Advanced users can explore and extend the data schemas used for agents and pets within Gun.js. *(Refer to `AgentCreationComponent.js` and `PetFormComponent.js` for current schemas)*.

*(Placeholder: Link to a future Wiki section on SPA Customization and Development Guide. The existing Wiki primarily covers the command-line tool.)*
The existing [Wiki](wiki.md) provides extensive details on the original ChatDev framework, some concepts of which may still be relevant for understanding agent roles and behaviors.

## ü§ó Share Your Creations

With the new ChatDev SPA, you can share:

*   **Agent Designs:** The definitions of your agents (system prompts, roles, chosen models). You can share these as text or JSON.
*   **Pet Parameters:** The JSON `spriteParams` and `toolSnippet.config` for your unique pets.
*   **Screenshots/Videos:** Show off your interactive sessions and unique agent-pet combinations!

We encourage you to share your innovative agent designs and pet creations with the community!

*(The "Code", "Company", and "Software" sub-sections from the original README are less directly applicable to the SPA's current functionality but the spirit of open contribution remains.)*
